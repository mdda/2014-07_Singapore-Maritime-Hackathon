2014-07_Singapore-Maritime-Hackathon
========================================================

This is built on top of the Hackathon starter pack (https://github.com/mdda/hackathon-starter-flask-plus).

I was in a bit of a hurry when pulling this together (can you guess why?), and it's now essentially dormant - but I've been backporting the interesting stuff to the main-line now that the weekend is over...

So, unless you're interested in Maritime matters, the action is elsewhere...


Interesting Stuff
---------------------

Triangles using d3.js onto Google maps : See ```backend/flask/www/templates/mpa/map.html```


Semi-Interesting Stuff
------------------------------------------

Parsing some CSV files into SQLite : See ```data/csv_to_sqlite.py```

Building some JSON data from the AIS captured in SQLite : See ```data/ais.py```
